## Introduction

FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use, while also providing excellent performance and automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation.

This repository aims to provide practical examples and projects that demonstrate the capabilities of FastAPI in creating RESTful APIs.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- **Mini Projects**: A collection of small-scale applications designed to demonstrate core programming concepts and practical implementations.
- **Weather API**: A simple API that provides current weather data based on location.
- **Todo List API**: An API for managing a todo list with CRUD operations.

Feel free to explore each project to understand how to implement RESTful APIs with FastAPI.

## Features

- Fast and efficient: FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks available.
- Easy to learn: Helps you build applications quickly with minimal code.
- Automatic interactive API documentation.
- Support for data validation through Python type annotations.
- Fully supported asynchronous programming.
